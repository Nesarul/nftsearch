2. Fix the version of Costs.ai that I put on BoredHumans.com at https://boredhumans.com/nftsearch.php . Attached is the zip file for it.
The search results work, but I can't get my header and footer to load for it. I don't want it in the costs.ai format, I want it in the BoredHumans.com format similar to https://boredhumans.com/text-to-image.php .

=========================================

3. I want to add 3 more pages to BoredHumans.com, similar to text-to-speech. But instead of text, each of these involves use the user uploading a media file instead.
Also, none of these need a bad words filter, but they all do need the IP address limiting system.

Attached is speech-to-text.php which is to use to get started with the speech-to-text page. You will need to have a form to allow the user to upload a file instead of typing text. Once you finish it, use that as a template to create the other 2 sites, as those both have file uploads also. Use POST for the form to my API.

The biggest problem with these 3 new pages is you need to create a system for allowing users to upload the files. It is too complicated (and takes too long) to pass the actual media file to my remote API (which then would need to pass it again to the source API I use), so instead I want to upload all the photos to https://boredhumans.com/uploads/ 
You can then pass the url for it (like https://boredhumans.com/uploads/eric.jpg) to my API.
Also, after you get a result URL back from my API, automatically delete the source image from my server.

Like with text-to-image, I had my programmer create an API for each of these 3 sites.

The 3 sites are:

A) Speech-To-Text (creates a transcript of an audio file). It accepts FLAC, WAV, or MP3 files.
See demo at https://replicate.com/openai/whisper
My API is:
POST http://51.68.206.144:8010/whisper
Body should be like this :
{
Â "file":"https://boredhumans.com/transcripts/audiofiles/videoplayback.mp3"
}

It will ouput a lot of info but all I want is the text, which is like this:  results.json['transcription']
My demo page for this is at https://boredhumans.com/speech-to-text.php


B) StyleClip (you upload a photo and can change the hair color and other things)
See demo at https://replicate.com/orpatashnik/styleclip
My API is: 
POST http://51.68.206.144:8011/styleclip
{
 "file":"https://i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/GettyImages-1092658864_hero-1024x575.jpg",
 "target": "a face with bald head"
}

The "target" is what you want to change the photo to. The ouptut will be an image url like with text-to-image.


C) Age Progression (you upload a photo and it shows what you look like younger or older) - https://replicate.com/yuval-alaluf/sam#run
See demo at https://replicate.com/yuval-alaluf/sam#run
My API is:
POST http://51.68.206.144:8012/age
{
 "file":"https://i0.wp.com/post.medicalnewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/GettyImages-1092658864_hero-1024x575.jpg",
 "age": 80
}

The ouptut will be an image url like with text-to-image.
